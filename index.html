	<p>I have gotten used to a different course setup, without taps for everything. all course materials used to be in the same place, it was easily accessible. I have read the wrong materials this week before I took the quiz and none of the quiz questions were in the reading. by the way i think this part is for the extra credit</p>
	<ul>
		<li>how often are gonna have to write codes?</li>
		<li>what do i need to do to be successful in this class</li>
		<li>how many hours of studying do you recomend?</li>
		<li> Is this enough for the extra credit?</li>
